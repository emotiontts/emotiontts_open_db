Row row row your boat
Gently down the stream
Merrily merrily merrily merrily
Life is but a dream

Row row row your boat
Gently up the creek
If you see a crocodile
Don't forget to shriek

Row row row your boat
Gently down the river
If you see a polar bear
Don't forget to shiver

Row row row your boat
Gently to the shore
If you see a lion there
Don’t forget to roar
