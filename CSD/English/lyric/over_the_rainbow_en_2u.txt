Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow kkies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me

Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow why then oh why can't I
